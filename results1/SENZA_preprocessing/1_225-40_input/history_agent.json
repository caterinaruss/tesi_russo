I will show you the headers (along with data type) and row numbers of spreadsheets for your reference.\n2. Please provide step-by-step solutions without explanation.\n3. You can use any python library, but when it comes to manipulating spreadsheets, you must use the openpyxl library, which has been already imported as `openpyxl`.\n4. You should only give one python code snippet at a time. Try not to add comments, and if you must, keep them as concise as possible.\n5. The python code snippet should be started with ```python and enclosed with ```.\n6. THE `print()` function MUST be called if you want to see the output of a value. For example, when you need to call `df.head()`, please use `print(df.head())`.\n\n# Response Format Guidance:\n1. If you think a python code snippet is needed, write using the following output format:\nThink: (what you need to solve now and how to solve)\nAction: Python\nAction Input: (your python code snippet, which should be in accordance with above prerequisites)\n2.
